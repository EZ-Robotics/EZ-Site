The next time I was running it, I needed to implement safeties to stop something like that from happening.\\n\\nAt Open Sauce I saw some self-balancing robots that used the same mpu6050 that I was trying to balance with which gave me more confidence that I could pull off what I was trying to pull off.  \\n\\nI also ran into the R2 Builders booth and discussed it with [CuriousMarc](https://www.curiousmarc.com/home).  I remember watching his YouTube videos back in ~2016, it was very cool to meet him.  He let me look inside the droid and we spoke for a bit.  He told me to start simple before jumping into a larger project like an R2. I realized then I had to simplify this project to get it done and making the entire project rely on something I wasn\'t 100% sure would work as well as I hoped was concerning. \\n\\nI started looking into drawings of droids and stumbled across this which feels so perfect.  It has the D-O tire but adds arms, and the body looks like an R2 but the head is a BB-8.  It seems perfect, and this became my reference photo for simplifying the project.\\n![](opensauce2023/dd3_sketch.png)\\n\\n---\\n## Long Beach Comic Con 2023\\nI saw there was a convention on September 2 and 3 and decided to sign up.  This would be my deadline for getting the robot presentable.\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nThis section is WIP\\n\\n:::\\n\\n---  \\n## OC Maker Faire 2023\\nGoal: October 21 2023 \\n### Plans\\nWith everything I learned talking to the other droid builders at Long Beach Comic Con, I decided to sand back paint on every part and redo them. The highest priority for me was to go to the next con with the robot working.  Here\'s my priority list:\\n- redoing the wiring, double check everything, adding speakers\\n- repaint everything\\n- practice traveling with the robot to make sure it works after travel\\n\\n### Redoing Wiring\\nI was pretty tired of breaking things and had help from Kiana Dumdumaya to make sure everything was being done correctly. \\n\\nThe first thing she did was make a Google Sheet with every component and connections between them, which I think is genius and super simple. \\n![](ocmakerfair2023/droid_wiring.png)\\n\\nKiana was much more methodical about testing everything than I had been.  I would look up how to connect a component and immediately solder it together, and test as I went.  Kiana made sure everything worked through a breadboard before making any connections and soldering after.  This process made me realize that my frustration with electronics is just my lack of methodology as I have with software and hardware.\\n![](ocmakerfair2023/breadboard.jpg)\\n\\nAn improvement we wanted to make to the wiring was to use SBUS instead of PWM on the receiver.  The receiver has 8 PWM pins, using them means we only have 8 channels from the transmitter to read and 8 pins on the Arduino get used.  SBUS is a serial protocol that can contain all of the channels on the transmitter and would only take UART on the Arduino.  \\n![](ocmakerfair2023/frsky_receiver.png)\\n\\nThis required making a serial inverter so the Arduino could read it, but after that, everything worked seamlessly with an [sbus library](https://github.com/bolderflight/sbus).  We found [this page](https://www.ernstc.dk/arduino/sbus.html) which had a schematic for a serial inverter for SBUS.\\n![](ocmakerfair2023/serial_onverter.jpg)\\n\\nI brought the robot to work to see if everything would work after packing it in the case and traveling with it.  I had a hiccup where my joystick inputs weren\'t doing anything, but I figured this would have been a problem with the on/off switch as that\'s the only thing that would stop the joysticks from moving.  I checked and a wire was unplugged from the Arduino, and everything worked after that!  \\n<iframe width=\\"315\\" height=\\"560\\"\\nsrc=\\"https://youtube.com/embed/IsVxDqDYuvk?si=QfPQhgxrZzTwgiFX\\"\\ntitle=\\"YouTube video player\\"\\nframeborder=\\"0\\"\\nallow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\"\\nallowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nI wanted to get speakers working for this event, but I couldn\'t get it to work in time.  The audio quality was terrible from PWM on the Arduino, and there wasn\'t time to get a better solution.  Audio will have to wait.\\n\\nI tried getting the communication between body and head Arduino to work, but I had a few problems.  The serial port on my Arduino was now being used for SBUS, and the software serial library made by Arduino wasn\'t working in my case and was causing the servos to stutter.  Even with that, as I was testing somehow the Arduino in the head shorted, it got extremely hot and wasn\'t responsive to anything.  \\n\\n### Repainting Everything\\nAt Long Beach Comic-Con, I asked the other builders how they finished their 3D prints to not look printed.  The suggestions were to:\\n1) sand a lot before putting anything on, get rid of layer lines, and make it smooth\\n2) use a filler, bondo spot putty, or filler primer\\n3) sand the primer back to smooth everything out\\n4) check if it needs another layer of primer/bondo and another sanding, repeat as needed\\n\\nWe also discussed how green isn\'t a Star Wars color.  And after I was told the green looked like guacamole, I wasn\'t feeling it.  So I decided to go to more of a yellow similar to the original reference drawing.\\n\\nI experimented on a small decorative piece on the leg, and focusing on step 1 to avoid a \\"garbage in, garbage out\\" scenario worked amazing.  Green is before, yellow is after.\\n![](ocmakerfair2023/green_original.jpg)\\n![](ocmakerfair2023/yellow_test.jpg)\\n\\nWith the amount I was going to be painting, I wanted a better solution to doing everything outside.  I built a ventilated spray paint booth, which I also have a project page on.\\n![](ocmakerfair2023/spraypaint_booth.jpg)\\n\\nI started this for some of the larger parts to get the worst of it over with, sanding takes forever.  After realizing how important the initial first step is, I paid more attention to it.  After sanding I\'d fill holes with bondo and sand it back.  I\'d also mix bondo and acetone to get a consistency of thick paint so I could cover large areas.  Doing this meant I needed to repeat the filler primer step much less. \\n![](ocmakerfair2023/sanding_more_parts.jpg)\\n\\nThe finish I could get was much better now.\\n![](ocmakerfair2023/og_vs_sanded.jpg)\\n![](ocmakerfair2023/post_filler_primer.jpg)\\n\\n### Testing and Fixes\\n\\nBecause of how overkill the motors are for this project, I needed to implement a slew rate to the drive.  The goal of this is to ramp up the power being sent to the motor.  If I tell the motors to go 30%, they should ramp up to that 30%.\\n\\nThis in itself is pretty simple.  I take the speed that was set to the motor, check if it\'s bigger or smaller than what we currently have, and add or subtract a constant to that number.  This loop iterates every 10ms and now we have a slew.\\n```cpp\\n// Slew the drive motors to avoid changes in motion that are too large\\ndouble l_target = 0.0, r_target = 0.0;\\ndouble l_current = 0.0, r_current = 0.0;\\nconst double MAX = 2;\\nvoid drive_set(double l, double r) {\\n  if (drive_switch_enabled()) {\\n    l_target = r_target = r_current = l_current = 0.0;\\n    drive_set_raw(l_target, r_target);\\n    return;\\n  }\\n  l_target = l;\\n  r_target = r;\\n\\n  double max = fmax(fabs(l_target), fabs(r_target));\\n  double l_add = MAX, r_add = MAX;\\n  if (fabs(l_target) > fabs(r_target)) {\\n    l_add = MAX;\\n    r_add = MAX;\\n  } else if (fabs(l_target) < fabs(r_target)) {\\n    l_add = MAX;\\n    r_add = MAX;\\n  }\\n\\n  if (l_current > l_target)\\n    l_current -= l_add;\\n  else if (l_current < l_target)\\n    l_current += l_add;\\n\\n  if (r_current > r_target)\\n    r_current -= r_add;\\n  else if (r_current < r_target)\\n    r_current += r_add;\\n\\n  drive_set_raw(l_current, r_current);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nA problem that I noticed after driving with this code is driving in arcs felt wrong.  If I drove in an arc, where the left side would go at 30 power and the right side at 15, both sides would increase at the same rate until the slower side hit 15.  So the robot would drive forward and then turn, even though I never told it to go forward.  \\n\\nI solved this by scaling the slower side down by the ratio of `slower side / faster side` with this code and everything felt significantly better.\\n```cpp\\n  double max = fmax(fabs(l_target), fabs(r_target));\\n  double min = fmin(fabs(l_target), fabs(r_target));\\n  double l_add = MAX, r_add = MAX;\\n  if (fabs(l_target) > fabs(r_target)) {\\n    l_add = MAX;\\n    r_add = MAX * (min / max);\\n  } else if (fabs(l_target) < fabs(r_target)) {\\n    l_add = MAX * (min / max);\\n    r_add = MAX;\\n  }\\n```\\n\\nI wanted to change the sensitivity of the joysticks, so I added the same joystick curve I\'ve been using on my VEX robots which I explain [here](https://ez-robotics.github.io/EZ-Template/tutorials/joystick_curve). \\n\\nBut the drive still felt strange.  It can\'t point turn nicely because it has 4 wheels that don\'t slide well.  There is some code in FRC called curvature drive which is single-stick arcade but makes the robot feel like a typical RC car.  One axis is forward / backward, and the other axis controls \\"the angle the front wheels are facing\\" but in code.  With the implementation I\'m using I can\'t point turn anymore, but I couldn\'t before anyway so that doesn\'t bother me. \\n```cpp\\n  // Curvature Drive from\\n  // https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib/blob/54995fd390aaf4d4949a516a76580c50b394912f/src/api/chassis/model/skidSteerModel.cpp#L140-L169\\n  double scale = max_speed;\\n  double forward = (joystick_curve_fwd(joystick_channel(LEFT_Y), curve_fwd)) / 127.0;\\n  double curve = (joystick_curve_turn(joystick_channel(LEFT_X), curve_turn)) / 127.0;\\n\\n  double left_speed = forward + fabs(forward) * curve;\\n  double right_speed = forward - fabs(forward) * curve;\\n\\n  // normalizes output\\n  double faster_side = fmax(fabs(left_speed), fabs(right_speed));\\n  if (faster_side > 1.0) {\\n    left_speed /= faster_side;\\n    right_speed /= faster_side;\\n  }\\n\\n  left_speed = left_speed * scale;\\n  right_speed = right_speed * scale;\\n```\\n\\nThere is a seam between both halves of the body and this always bothered me.  I was going to try to make a strip that goes up along the seam so it\'s covered by something that looks like an intentional vertical line.  \\n\\nKiana suggested instead of that to just have something that wraps around the body and squeezes it all together.  I was skeptical because of the strange geometry of that part of the body, but after she drew this image I felt like it was worth it.\\n![](ocmakerfair2023/drawn_seam_fixer.png)\\n![](ocmakerfair2023/real_seam_fixer.jpg)\\n\\nI finished up the pelican case and added spots for the batteries and the controller. \\n![](ocmakerfair2023/bottom_case.jpg)\\n![](ocmakerfair2023/middle_case.jpg)\\n![](ocmakerfair2023/top_case.jpg)\\n\\nI wanted to bring it to work again to make sure everything was still working, and good thing I did.  I was having a strange issue where the switch wasn\'t working again, but this time everything seemed like it was plugged in.  At this point there had been 2 problems with the switch, so after work, I reprogrammed the switch to be on the controller instead.  I brought it back to work the next day and everything was working perfectly. I added safety so that when the switch goes from disabled to enabled, nothing turns on for 3 seconds.\\n\\n### At the Event\\n![](banner.jpg)\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QHBAFHdF71U?si=WKsknEyCu6PMA-Uy\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n![](lacomicon2023/r2_bully.jpg)\\n\\n---  \\n## LA Comic Con 2023\\nGoal: December 2, 2023\\n### Plans\\nThere is a lot I\'d like to change to the robot, but I can only give it so much time.  This is the priority list for changes I\'d like to make, and we\'ll get to as many as we can:\\n- use gyros in the controller to decide when the controller is set down and disable the robot if it\'s set down for too long\\n- fix the anything that broke after it drove off of a table\\n- wire the head servos to the body\\n- stop controller \\"activity warning\\" and brushless ESC\'s beeping when left alone for too long\\n- redo the entire head tilt for a delta linkage\\n- change ring gear for a wheel that\'s sprung into a track for longevity when kids try to spin the head  \\n- speakers\\n\\n\\n### Controller AFK Shutoff\\nI want the robot to turn itself off when I set the controller down, but only sometimes.  When the eye/eyebrows are fully done, I\'d like to be able to leave the robot on and let everything animate on its own. \\n\\nThere is a switch on the controller to disable all head movement, and there\'s a switch on the controller to disable the drive.  If the drive is left on I want the robot to disable when I set the controller down.  But if the drive is off, nothing should turn off when I set the controller down.  \\n\\nI don\'t want the robot to turn off while I\'m using the joysticks, even if the robot is completely still.  Currently, I only check if the joysticks have been used recently and allow this function to run when they haven\'t, but I need to add every input on the controller to that list.  So only after no input has been touched for X amount of time will we start checking for the controller being set down. \\n\\nThen we check the position over time (velocity) of the controller to see if it\'s sitting.  If it is, a timer starts, and after that amount of time has passed the robot will shut off.\\n\\nThis needs a little less sensitivity to moving.  Currently, if the controller is on a table and someone walks nearby the controller thinks it\'s moving.\\n\\n```cpp\\n  // Disable drive if the controller is set down for a certain amount of time\\n  if (controller_switch_output & !are_joysticks_running()) {\\n    // Current values\\n    int cur_x = joystick_channel(GYRO_X);\\n    int cur_y = joystick_channel(GYRO_Y);\\n\\n    // Figure out the velocity of the controller\\n    int x = cur_x - last_x;\\n    int y = cur_y - last_y;\\n\\n    // Give wiggle room for noise\\n    // x = abs(x) <= 1 ? 0 : x;\\n    // y = abs(y) <= 1 ? 0 : y;\\n\\n    last_x = cur_x;\\n    last_y = cur_y;\\n\\n    // If X and Y velocity are 0, and either X or Y isn\'t currently at 0 degrees, start the timer\\n    if (x == 0 && y == 0 && (cur_x != 0 || cur_y != 0))\\n      afk_timer += 20;\\n    else\\n      afk_timer = 0;\\n\\n  } else {\\n    afk_timer = 0;\\n  }\\n\\n  // Once the timer has reached 2000, disable everything on the robot\\n  if (afk_timer >= 2000) {\\n    controller_switch_timer = false;\\n    startup_switch_output = false;\\n    last_switch_state = true;\\n    controller_switch_timer = 0;\\n    afk_timer = 0;\\n    return;\\n  }\\n```\\n\\n### Fixing the Fall\\nFirst, everything comes apart...\\n![](lacomicon2023/PXL_20231122_210748901.jpg)\\n\\nAll of the damage went to the head.  A lot of mechanical parts that were hot glued on have fallen off, and some paint is chipped all around the eye. \\n\\nI\'m starting by hot-gluing everything back into place.  It\'s a pretty gross process, it isn\'t leading to consistency between both eyebrows which are meant to be the same.  The eye is a mess too- I saw another builder use springs instead of wire so nothing breaks when it\'s hit, and that\'s something I\'d like to use. \\n\\nAfter fixing everything mechanically it\'s shown me how unhappy I am with the construction of the head.  After this event, I need to find a better solution to my problems with it.  Maybe it\'s 3D printing a new head, or it\'s just making entire subsystems that are printed and get hot glued in, instead of relying on hot glue to index everything inside the head. Who could have guessed that would be inconsistent?\\n\\nSome paint scratched too.  I have two options for repairing scratches, I can either repaint it and continuously try to keep it perfect, or I can repair it and over time this will gain natural weathering.  I\'m going to fix it over time.  The front yellow plate fell off during the fall and the eye took a big scratch, exposing bondo spot putty that was used to fill some gaps. \\n![](lacomicon2023/eye_before.jpg)\\n\\nThe color isn\'t an exact match, but it\'s hard to tell that my black acrylic paint was more matte than the rest of the head because the yellow part acts as a barrier. \\n![](lacomicon2023/eye_after.jpg)\\n\\nThe body cracked a little at some weaker points in the design.  There isn\'t much scratched on the body though.\\n![](lacomicon2023/boyd_before.jpg)\\n\\nI filled the parts that did scratch with some yellow paint and filled the vent with a lighter gray on the inside and gold around.  I like the idea of yellow exposing itself when the black scratches. \\n![](lacomicon2023/body_after.jpg)\\n\\n### Wiring Head Servos to the Body\\nI tried to find a place to plug the servos into the servo board but the pins on the servo board are completely inaccessible.  The opposite side of the blue board needs to be reached.\\n![](lacomicon2023/PXL_20231122_222634312.jpg)\\n\\nWhere this looks from the other side. \\n![](lacomicon2023/PXL_20231122_222628747.jpg)\\n\\nThe only solution I could come up with was to remove the servo board, desolder some pins, and flip them to the other side, which worked out.  Now to add wires the polycarbonate just has to be removed. \\n![](lacomicon2023/flipped_pins.jpg)\\n\\nThen it\'s just wiring everything together and labeling all the wires.\\n![](lacomicon2023/head_wired.jpg)\\n\\n### Automated Animations"},{"id":"adaptive-pid","metadata":{"permalink":"/projects/adaptive-pid","source":"@site/projects/2023-11-22-adaptive-pid/index.md","title":"Adaptive PID","description":"Adaptive PID is a modification of PID that scales constants based on the robot\'s tested velocity curve.","date":"2023-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 22, 2023","tags":[{"label":"software","permalink":"/projects/tags/software"},{"label":"vex","permalink":"/projects/tags/vex"},{"label":"wip","permalink":"/projects/tags/wip"}],"readingTime":3.9233333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jess Zarchi","title":"Roboticist","url":"https://roboticsisez.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/Unionjackjz1.png","key":"jess"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"adaptive-pid","title":"Adaptive PID","authors":["jess"],"tags":["software","vex","wip"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"DD-3","permalink":"/projects/dd-3"},"nextItem":{"title":"Spraypaint Booth","permalink":"/projects/spraypaint-booth"}},"content":"Adaptive PID is a modification of PID that scales constants based on the robot\'s tested velocity curve.\\r\\n\\r\\n![](banner.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e \\r\\n---\\r\\n## About\\r\\nWhen a robot is moving it generates momentum.  PID is extremely consistent when the momentum of the system is constant.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen tuning constants for moving, I always notice that after ~2\' of movement the robot is extremely consistent.  In the closer distances, the constants aren\'t quite right, because the momentum is different from when it\'s going full speed.  This is an even larger problem with turns, as the robot never reaches a constant momentum.  \\r\\n\\r\\nA solution I want to avoid is tuning PID constants for multiple turn amounts and interpolating between them.  I haven\'t tested this, but I\'m extremely confident this would be the best solution.  I do not like how much time this takes to set up and tune for each new robot.  My goal is to find a lazier solution that gets almost all of the way there. \\r\\n\\r\\n## EZ-Templates Implemented Solution\\r\\nI had this problem when I was a competitor, and my solution was to:\\r\\n- not run turns as fast as I could, at ~70% power\\r\\n- slow down the robot within some band of the target \\r\\n\\r\\nThis allowed me to have 1 tuned constant and the robot would slow down early for larger movements making everything more similar than without this.  It isn\'t a perfect solution though, it has all of the same problems as not having it but less.  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Detecting When Speed Drops\\r\\nThe first thing I tried was to find 2 parameters: what was the max power being sent to the motors and for how long?  I\'d keep track of all of this during the turn, and when the power started to go down I recognized that as my stopping point.  Now I have these two numbers and I use them to modify all of my PID constants.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis would sometimes look promising but overall it felt like I needed to tune how much pull/push the two parameters gave to the PID constants for different distances, which defeats the purpose of what I\'m trying to do. \\r\\n```cpp\\r\\nvoid time_full_speed() {\\r\\n  default_constants();\\r\\n  pros::delay(50);\\r\\n  int time_passed = 50;\\r\\n  int i = 0;\\r\\n  std::vector<int> last_power = chassis.drive_get();\\r\\n  std::vector<int> all_powers;\\r\\n  while (true) {\\r\\n    pros::delay(ez::util::DELAY_TIME);\\r\\n    time_passed += ez::util::DELAY_TIME;\\r\\n    printf(\\"%i:   %i != %i\\\\n\\", time_passed, chassis.drive_get()[0], last_power[0]);\\r\\n\\r\\n    int error = abs(chassis.drive_get()[0]) - abs(last_power[0]);\\r\\n    all_powers.push_back(abs(chassis.drive_get()[0]));\\r\\n\\r\\n    if (error < -1) {\\r\\n      i++;\\r\\n    } else {\\r\\n      i = 0;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\n    if (i >= 3) {\\r\\n      printf(\\"%i\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\", time_passed);\\r\\n      break;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\n    last_power = chassis.drive_get();\\r\\n  }\\r\\n  double average_power = 0.0;\\r\\n  for (auto i : all_powers) {\\r\\n    average_power += i;\\r\\n  }\\r\\n  average_power /= all_powers.size();\\r\\n  double time_conversion = (360.0 / (double)time_passed);\\r\\n  double speed_conversion = 80.0 / average_power;\\r\\n  auto consts = chassis.pid_turn_constants_get();\\r\\n  double conversion = (time_conversion) + (speed_conversion);\\r\\n  double max = 1.75;\\r\\n  // conversion = conversion > max ? max : conversion;\\r\\n  conversion = conversion < 1 ? 1 : conversion;\\r\\n  // consts.kp = consts.kp * conversion;\\r\\n  // consts.kd = consts.kd * conversion;\\r\\n  consts.start_i = consts.start_i / conversion;\\r\\n  chassis.turnPID.integral = 0;\\r\\n  chassis.pid_turn_min_set(chassis.pid_turn_min_get() / (conversion * 1.5));\\r\\n  // chassis.pid_speed_max_set(chassis.pid_speed_max_get() / conversion);\\r\\n  chassis.pid_turn_constants_set(consts.kp, consts.ki, consts.kd, consts.start_i);\\r\\n  printf(\\"Time Passed: %i  Last Power: %i Average Power: %.2f    \\\\nTime Conversion: %.2f  Speed Conversion: %.2f  Conversion: %.2f   \\\\nkP: %.2f  kD: %.2f  start i: %.0f  min: %i  max: %i\\\\n\\", time_passed, last_power[0], average_power, time_conversion, speed_conversion, conversion, consts.kp, consts.kd, consts.start_i, chassis.pid_turn_min_get(), chassis.pid_speed_max_get());\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nvoid turning_test() {\\r\\n  chassis.pid_turn_set(90_deg, TURN_SPEED);\\r\\n  time_full_speed();\\r\\n  chassis.pid_wait();\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Moving Target with Motion Profiling\\r\\nI took the motion profile test I made for Captain R3X and implemented it here.  This works in the same way it would with a servo, where it sets new target positions for the PID to reach and the rate of change of new targets is being controlled.  This seemed promising, but because I\'m not controlling velocity this wasn\'t working too well.  The robot would move nicely until the end of the motion where the robot would reach its target and stop, then go to the next target, etc.  The robot was stuttering through the end of the motion.  \\r\\n\\r\\n## Acceleration Test\\r\\nI keep thinking back to [TrueSpeed](https://www.vexforum.com/t/24cs-motor-control-value-remapping/23959/1), a fix for VEX\'s motor controllers that weren\'t linear.  The values were remapped and normalized giving a linear output through a LUT (look-up table).\\r\\n\\r\\nI tried something similar.  I told the robot to go at some speed and read the rate of change of the IMU.  After some target degree was passed I stopped reading velocity.  This was done for 17 different target values, running each test 6 times, 3 left and 3 right.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll of that gave me this graph.  The x-axis is the target we were reading to, and the y-axis is the average velocity in the time it took to get there. \\r\\n![](banner.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nTo use this graph I scaled the Y axis down to 1 by dividing everything by the largest tested Y point.  That left me with many points I can draw lines through and find new conversion rates for untested turn amounts.  I took my conversion rate and I changed my constants by that.  And... it worked!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this test, the first set of turns is the standard EZ-Template.  The second set of turns is using the modified constants. \\r\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qdRAPPe5oj8?si=n4ZuJxHNptZo0IWk\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\n```cpp\\r\\nstd::vector<std::vector<double>> scaling = {\\r\\n    {0, 0},\\r\\n    {2.5, 0.09400453473},\\r\\n    {7.5, 0.2022555992},\\r\\n    {12.5, 0.2646745481},\\r\\n    {17.5, 0.3548182873},\\r\\n    {22.5, 0.3951412327},\\r\\n    {27.5, 0.4499251424},\\r\\n    {42.5, 0.5630226236},\\r\\n    {57.5, 0.6381967848},\\r\\n    {72.5, 0.6967510482},\\r\\n    {87.5, 0.7629670943},\\r\\n    {102.5, 0.7982267571},\\r\\n    {117.5, 0.8649159207},\\r\\n    {132.5, 0.8999937274},\\r\\n    {147.5, 0.9429511551},\\r\\n    {162.5, 0.976136005},\\r\\n    {177.5, 1},\\r\\n};\\r\\n\\r\\ndouble get_scale(double target) {\\r\\n  // Find a point that is larger than then target\\r\\n  double initial_error = target - chassis.turnPID.target_get();\\r\\n  initial_error = fabs(initial_error);\\r\\n  int i = 0;\\r\\n  for (auto j : scaling) {\\r\\n    if (j[0] >= fabs(initial_error)) \\r\\n      break;\\r\\n    i++;\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n  // If target is equal to or larger than our largest tested point, return 1.0\\r\\n  if (i == scaling.size())\\r\\n    return 1.0;\\r\\n  // If target is equal to or smaller than our smallest tested point, return the smallest conversion\\r\\n  else if (initial_error == scaling[i][0])\\r\\n    return scaling[i][1];\\r\\n\\r\\n  // Draw lines between each point\\r\\n  double m = (scaling[i][1] - scaling[i - 1][1]) / (scaling[i][0] - scaling[i - 1][0]);  // (y2-y1) / (x2-x1)\\r\\n  double b = scaling[i][1] - (m * scaling[i][0]);                                        // b = y - mx\\r\\n  double y = (m * initial_error) + b;                                                    // y = mx + b\\r\\n\\r\\n  return y;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nvoid smooth-turn(okapi::QAngle p_target, int speed) {\\r\\n  default_constants();\\r\\n  double conversion = get_scale(p_target.convert(okapi::degree));\\r\\n  auto consts = chassis.pid_turn_constants_get();\\r\\n  consts.kp = consts.kp * conversion;\\r\\n  consts.kd = consts.kd * conversion;\\r\\n  consts.ki = consts.ki * conversion;\\r\\n  consts.start_i = consts.start_i * conversion;\\r\\n  chassis.pid_turn_constants_set(consts.kp, consts.ki, consts.kd, consts.start_i);\\r\\n  printf(\\"\\\\nConversion: %.2f   kP: %.2f  kD: %.2f  start i: %.0f  min: %i  max: %i\\\\n\\", conversion, consts.kp, consts.kd, consts.start_i, chassis.pid_turn_min_get(), chassis.pid_speed_max_get());\\r\\n\\r\\n  chassis.pid_turn_set(p_target, speed);\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the tests for the data that was collected, the speed that the robot was going at is constant.

I saw online that people had little booths to spray paint and airbrush in.  I looked to buy one and they were ~$70 for the cheapest one I could find and it was tiny, and larger ones couldn\'t fold up for storage.  I decided to make my own.  \\n\\nI had some aluminum 1/2\\" angle and decided that I\'d build it all out of that.  I want to comfortably fit an R2 dome inside, so this needs to be at least 18\\".  I like having more room on the bottom for laying out parts, and after playing with some lengths on my workbench I decided on 30\\" wide and 24\\" deep.  Deciding height was trickier, the fan is more effective the smaller the volume of the box is.  Ultimately I decided the back top edge wasn\'t going to be useful space, so the back of the box was going to be 18\\" and the front 26\\".  \\n![](side24.png)\\n![](side18.png)\\n\\nI designed 3D-printed brackets to connect all of the angles.  The small back rectangle is being treated as the main box, and everything is pivoting around that for fold-up.  \\n![](no-support.png)\\n\\nI added diagonals to stop everything from collapsing, and that\'s the design done.  The back rectangle has enough space for a fan and filter to be added, I will figure that out when I get there. \\n![](banner.png)\\n\\nAssembly all worked out like in CAD.  For the fan, I\'m using the cheapest bathroom exhaust fan Home Depot had, rated for 50 cubic feet per minute which is much larger than the volume of this booth. An air filter gets press-fit over that, and the exhaust fan goes directly out my window.   \\n![](first_assemble.jpg)\\n\\nTo fill in the sides I was originally going to use cardboard, but I wanted a replaceable surface on the inside so when it got gross with paint I could have a fresh surface.  I tried forgoing the cardboard entirely and just gift-wrapping the box in thin plastic, which was functional but looked awful and was harder to replace than if I had cardboard.  With cardboard walls, I can just tape the plastic over the inside.  To replace this, I have to remove the booth from my desk and roll it around in plastic.  It also looks bad.  But this is a tool for me to complete another project, so I will fix that another day.\\n![](gift_wrapped.jpg)\\n\\nThe lighting inside the box was horrible, so I got a small garage light and mounted it to the front. \\n![](garage_light.jpg)\\n\\nMy next steps are to:\\n- add cardboard walls\\n- add an on/off switch for the exhaust\\n- wire the light and exhaust to a single cable"},{"id":"french-cleats","metadata":{"permalink":"/projects/french-cleats","source":"@site/projects/2023-07-05-french-cleats/index.md","title":"French Cleats","description":"I designed and built French cleats for storing tools on my wall.","date":"2023-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 5, 2023","tags":[{"label":"hardware","permalink":"/projects/tags/hardware"},{"label":"cad","permalink":"/projects/tags/cad"},{"label":"wip","permalink":"/projects/tags/wip"}],"readingTime":1.81,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jess Zarchi","title":"Roboticist","url":"https://roboticsisez.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/Unionjackjz1.png","key":"jess"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"french-cleats","title":"French Cleats","authors":["jess"],"tags":["hardware","cad","wip"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Spraypaint Booth","permalink":"/projects/spraypaint-booth"},"nextItem":{"title":"EZ-Template","permalink":"/projects/about-ez-template"}},"content":"I designed and built French cleats for storing tools on my wall.\\n\\n![](banner.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n---\\n\\nIt was becoming impossible to work on any project without my working surfaces covered in tools.  The tools have homes, but they are in drawers or not close to where I\'m working.  I need a 1 step solution to store things I use often, and I\'m going to use my wall for that. \\n\\nI don\'t think pegboards look very good (and are strangely expensive), and currently I sleep in the room I make things in so that matters to me.  I discovered what French cleats were through [Hank Green](https://youtu.be/KIqs4zIovTk?si=GSH6dp7U7DM5r2E4&t=178) in his office tour.  I remembered seeing them somewhere else and found it\'s a common enough workshop storage solution.  I found options for things complete systems I could buy but they were all so expensive.  I priced everything out to be significantly cheaper through McMaster, and even cheaper when I went to pick it up instead of paying for shipping. \\n\\nInstead of machining a 45-degree angle into metal which I don\'t have the tools for, I decided on leaving a gap between the wall and a piece of metal.  There will be a piece of plastic between them.  This lets me have a matching shape on something I mount to the wall.  \\n![](cleat_cad.png)\\n\\nI mounted the plastic and aluminum to my wall after making sure I was hitting studs and everything was level, and started work on a drill mount. I have a piece of plastic going inside the gap between the aluminum and my wall, and I\'m using 1/2\\" angle to make the holder for the drill. \\n![](drill_started.jpg)\\n\\nI free-handed the design and hole placement but it came out working nicely.  \\n![](drill_done.jpg)\\n\\nI designed caliper holders and a mount for a paper towel holder.  (yes the tape isn\'t level, my marker lines are level though)\\n![](caliper.jpg)\\n\\nIt\'s a lot of work to design a custom holder for everything I want on the wall.  Of course, some things will need to be custom, but in general, I\'d like to try to use some generic hook design.\\n![](big_hook_cad.png)\\n\\nWith this as a base, it\'s much easier to add modifications to it.  This is much nicer than making a custom holder for every part. \\n![](hot_glue_gun_holder.jpg)\\n![](ipa.jpg)\\n\\nI took my drill bit case took out each section, and made simple brackets for them to go on the wall with.  \\n![](drill_index.png)\\n![](drill_index_wall.jpg)\\n\\nI tried to make a hexagonal little crate to hold markers and maybe pens but it ended up looking really ugly because of the amount of wasted space.  I changed the design for a strip of poly spaced out from the wall acting like a belt and this works and looks much better.\\n![](marker1.jpg)\\n![](marker2.jpg)\\n\\nI mounted more aluminum to my wall near my workbench and have homes for tools I use often there.  I bought a Milwaukee screwdriver holder for their pack-out system, but just drilled holes in it and mounted a bit of aluminum to go around the French cleat.  I used one of the generic hooks to hold pliers and snips.\\n![](workbench1.jpg)\\n\\nNext, I need to find homes for:\\n- sandpaper\\n- spray paint\\n- Bondo\\n- tape\\n- spray paint\\n- dremel and dremel bits\\n- dykem"},{"id":"about-ez-template","metadata":{"permalink":"/projects/about-ez-template","source":"@site/projects/2023-03-30-ez-template/index.md","title":"EZ-Template","description":"EZ-Template is a simple plug-and-play PROS template that handles drive-base functions for VEX robots.","date":"2023-03-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 30, 2023","tags":[{"label":"vex","permalink":"/projects/tags/vex"},{"label":"mentoring","permalink":"/projects/tags/mentoring"},{"label":"tutorials","permalink":"/projects/tags/tutorials"},{"label":"software","permalink":"/projects/tags/software"},{"label":"open source","permalink":"/projects/tags/open-source"},{"label":"wip","permalink":"/projects/tags/wip"}],"readingTime":3.3,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jess Zarchi","title":"Roboticist","url":"https://roboticsisez.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/Unionjackjz1.png","key":"jess"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"about-ez-template","title":"EZ-Template","authors":["jess"],"tags":["vex","mentoring","tutorials","software","open source","wip"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"French Cleats","permalink":"/projects/french-cleats"},"nextItem":{"title":"Pure Pursuit","permalink":"/projects/pure-pursuit"}},"content":"import Tabs from \'@theme/Tabs\';\\r\\nimport TabItem from \'@theme/TabItem\';\\r\\n\\r\\n[EZ-Template](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template) is a simple plug-and-play PROS template that handles drive-base functions for VEX robots.  \\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template\\r\\n\\r\\n![](banner.jpg)\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n---\\r\\n:::note\\r\\n\\r\\nEZ-Template has its own website for documentation [here](https://ez-robotics.github.io/EZ-Template/).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## About\\r\\nMany students using VEXcode rely on the built-in Drivetrain class, but it often falls short in addressing the nuances of creating consistent autonomous routines, leading to frustration for new programmers. Issues like wheel slop and mechanical obstructions can be challenging to diagnose, causing students to lose interest in robotics.\\r\\n\\r\\nEZ-Template solves these problems by giving simple code that has been tested to work.  If something goes wrong, a student can try to tune the PID after fixing mechanical problems (which you can\'t do in VEXcode).  It eliminates one point of failure to keep students more interested in robotics.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis project taught me the importance of listening to user feedback and making adjustments accordingly.  I got feedback that users would prefer instructions in the code rather than figure it out from scratch in the docs, so I made sure every version was released with functions used in an example project.\\r\\n\\r\\n## [v1.x](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template/tree/f4c287dc3cea8c95cdbbd47939ef41c1d5a2f749)\\r\\n### About\\r\\nThe goal of EZ-Template shifted over time. This started out as my [codebase on my Tower Takeover robot](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-GOOFY), and as I progressed through Change Up I got increasingly annoyed at how convoluted it was to give the code all the information it needed.  I made a brand new project and copied over all of my drive base code, and had a [single configuration file](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template/blob/f4c287dc3cea8c95cdbbd47939ef41c1d5a2f749/include/EZ-Template/setup.hpp).  \\r\\n\\r\\n### Features\\r\\n- simple to set up a project\\r\\n- drive, turn, and swing turn PID \\r\\n- speed ramp-up for driving\\r\\n- asynchronous PID with blocking functions until settled and until a specific position has come\\r\\n- joystick input curves\\r\\n- live adjustment of the curves through the controller\\r\\n- basic autonomous selector\\r\\n\\r\\n### Issues\\r\\nThe code for this version was less than ideal.  The [main file was ~500 lines](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template/blob/f4c287dc3cea8c95cdbbd47939ef41c1d5a2f749/src/EZ-Template/auton_drive_functions.cpp), with no real structure to anything.  The code worked, and because this was originally intended for only me to use I felt this was fine.  As more people used it, more errors were caught and it was clunky for users to update the library.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe code needed to be cleaned and it had to be easier for users to update the library.\\r\\n\\r\\n## [v2.x](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template/tree/c4a5fd048f90363cc3f841abcb05c95eec2d36c3)\\r\\n### About\\r\\nThis was a complete rewrite of EZ-Template taking advantage of [PROS templates](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/cli/conductor.html), done with the help of a group of students.  Setup was now done in a constructor and an example project comes loaded with comments and autonomous routines for users to test and play with how the library works.  \\r\\n\\r\\n### Features\\r\\n- SD card saving \\r\\n- \\"tug of war\\" detection in autonomous\\r\\n- PID exits for when drive motors overheat\\r\\n- right stick arcade\\r\\n- loading animation during IMU calibration\\r\\n- 3 wire / smart encoder encoder support\\r\\n- add/remove motors from the drive dynamically if a team uses a PTO\\r\\n- exposed PID class \\r\\n- classed away autonomous selector that is easier to use\\r\\n\\r\\n### Issues\\r\\nMy biggest problem with v1.x and v2.x of EZ-Template is they are *too* easy.  EZ-Template comes with PID and exit condition constants that I tuned for some of my robots.  They were working pretty well within my similar robots, but I assumed everyone would have to tune their own PID because of variances in their robots to mine.  Over the course of a few seasons, this assumption has been proven very wrong.  The average team has to do little to no tuning to get consistent results, and that isn\'t my goal with EZ-Template.  The next version of EZ-Template will need to find a way to solve this.\\r\\n\\r\\n## v3.x\\r\\n:::note\\r\\n\\r\\nEZ-Template v3 is not released yet, there is incomplete documentation for it [here](https://ez-robotics.github.io/EZ-Template/next)\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n### About\\r\\nThis version needs to solve the pre-tuned PID values.  The obvious solution to the problem is to not ship EZ-Template with pre-tuned constants but leave everything else the same.  Teams will know to copy/paste old constants, and my problem isn\'t solved. \\r\\n\\r\\nEZ-Template uses a base unit of \\"ticks\\".  One tick means different things depending on the gear ratio of the drive, wheel size, motor cartridge, and what encoder they are using.  This means if a team wanted to switch from using the motor\'s built-in encoders to tracking wheels, they would have to completely retune everything. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis version of EZ-Template will solve this problem by using a base unit of inches.  No matter what sensor the user has, the code will always use inches.  This adds clarity for users by giving units, makes it so users can switch from built-in encoders to tracking wheels and keep the same constants, and stops forward/reverse v2 constants from working in v3.  \\r\\n<Tabs\\r\\n  groupId=\\"ex1\\"\\r\\n  defaultValue=\\"v2\\"\\r\\n  values={[\\r\\n    { label: \'v2.x\',  value: \'v2\', },\\r\\n    { label: \'v3.x\',  value: \'v3\', },\\r\\n  ]\\r\\n}>\\r\\n\\r\\n<TabItem value=\\"v2\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n```cpp\\r\\n  chassis.set_drive_pid(24, DRIVE_SPEED);\\r\\n  chassis.wait_drive();\\r\\n\\r\\n  chassis.set_turn_pid(45, TURN_SPEED);\\r\\n  chassis.wait_drive();\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n</TabItem>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<TabItem value=\\"v3\\">\\r\\n\\r\\n```cpp\\r\\n  chassis.pid_drive_set(24_in, DRIVE_SPEED);\\r\\n  chassis.pid_wait();\\r\\n\\r\\n  chassis.pid_turn_set(45_deg, TURN_SPEED);\\r\\n  chassis.pid_wait();\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n</TabItem>\\r\\n</Tabs>\\r\\n\\r\\n3.x of EZ-Template will also include a complete redo of all function names.

This makes sense in English, but while I was working with [LVGL](https://lvgl.io/) I realized the benefit of naming in order of what you\'re looking for.  So now it\'d be `.pid_drive_set`.  If you\'re looking to see everything you can do with PID on the drive, if you type `.pid_drive_` autocomplete will show you everything.  This makes autocomplete a more more useful tool when you don\'t know everything you can do in the library.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Features\\r\\n- renamed functions\\r\\n- a relative turn function so it\'s not always absolute\\r\\n- a relative swing function so it\'s not always absolute\\r\\n- add piston and pistongroup class\\r\\n- practice mode for driving\\r\\n- [okapi units](https://okapilib.github.io/OkapiLib/md_docs_api_units.html) (so you can now use cm, in, meters, tiles, etc.)"},{"id":"pure-pursuit","metadata":{"permalink":"/projects/pure-pursuit","source":"@site/projects/2023-03-21-pure-pursuit/index.md","title":"Pure Pursuit","description":"Pure Pursuit is a path-tracking algorithm that enables a robot to chase a \\"carrot on a stick\\".","date":"2023-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 21, 2023","tags":[{"label":"vex","permalink":"/projects/tags/vex"},{"label":"software","permalink":"/projects/tags/software"},{"label":"wip","permalink":"/projects/tags/wip"}],"readingTime":5.09,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jess Zarchi","title":"Roboticist","url":"https://roboticsisez.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/Unionjackjz1.png","key":"jess"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"pure-pursuit","title":"Pure Pursuit","authors":["jess"],"tags":["vex","software","wip"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"EZ-Template","permalink":"/projects/about-ez-template"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Pushbot","permalink":"/projects/the-pushbot"}},"content":"[Pure Pursuit](https://www.mathworks.com/help/nav/ug/pure-pursuit-controller.html) is a path-tracking algorithm that enables a robot to chase a \\"carrot on a stick\\".  \\n\\n![](banner.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n---\\n\\nPure Pursuit is a tracking algorithm that allows a robot to follow a given path by following a point some distance ahead like a carrot on a stick.  It requires some way of knowing where your current position is and a generated path.\\n\\n## Position Tracking\\nPosition tracking is a piece of code that given 2 or 3 encoders you can extrapolate the X, Y, and angle of the robot.\\n\\nThis is explained far better by others, and here are the resources that I used:  \\n[5225A Tracking Documentation](https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/software/odometry)  \\n[QUEEN Video Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T6KHywSP58)\\n\\nThis code relies on the speed at which sensors update, because it figures out the change in position over the time it takes for sensors to update, and adds that change to a current global value.  \\n\\n`LEFT_OFFSET` and `RIGHT_OFFSET` are the \\"track width\\".  This is the width between the tracking wheels on the robot,  I have them split into 2 variables because technically they do not need to be the same number.  \\n`CENTER_OFFSET` is the distance from a perpendicular tracking wheel to the turning center of the robot.  This number can actually be anything, but the nicest way is for this to align with the robot\'s turning center.  This can be tuned by turning the robot in place and adjusting this number until the XY stops rotating around the robot. \\n```cpp\\nvoid tracking_task() {\\n  double l_current = 0, r_current = 0;\\n  double c_current = 0;\\n  double l = 0, r = 0, c = 0;  // delta distance\\n  double l_last = 0, r_last = 0, c_last = 0;\\n  double radius_r = 0, radius_c = 0, h = 0, h2 = 0;  // rad for big circle\\n  double beta = 0, alpha = 0, theta = 0;\\n  double Xx = 0, Yy = 0, Xy = 0, Yx = 0;\\n  while (true) {\\n    l_current = get_raw_left();\\n    r_current = get_raw_right();\\n    c_current = get_raw_center();\\n\\n    l = l_current - l_last;\\n    r = r_current - r_last;\\n    c = c_current - c_last;\\n\\n    l_last = l_current;\\n    r_last = r_current;\\n    c_last = c_current;\\n\\n    double width = LEFT_OFFSET + RIGHT_OFFSET;\\n\\n    // diff between wheels for correcting turning\\n    theta = (l - r) / width;\\n\\n    if (theta != 0) {\\n      radius_r = r / theta;\\n      beta = theta / 2.0;\\n      h = ((radius_r + RIGHT_OFFSET) * sin(beta)) * 2.0;\\n      radius_c = c / theta;\\n      h2 = (radius_c + CENTER_OFFSET) * 2.0 * sin(beta);\\n    } else {\\n      h = l;\\n      h2 = 0;\\n      beta = 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    alpha = angle_rad + beta;\\n\\n    Xx = h2 * cos(alpha);\\n    Xy = h2 * -sin(alpha);\\n    Yx = h * sin(alpha);\\n    Yy = h * cos(alpha);\\n\\n    current.x += (Xx + Yx) / TICK_PER_INCH;\\n    current.y += (Xy + Yy) / TICK_PER_INCH;\\n    angle_rad += theta;\\n    current.theta = to_deg(angle_rad);\\n\\n    pros::delay(1);\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n## Mecanum Drive\\nMecanum wheels allow the robot to move forward / backward and side to side.  These wheels get their own section here because they are effectively a cheat code for getting this code to work.  Because they can strafe, any error that\'s accumulated along the way can be accounted for.  With a drivetrain that cannot strafe, if you aren\'t following the path as exactly as you can, it becomes extremely difficult to account for it later.  This is why I chose this drive first, it allows me to go through all of this code without the problems that a typical drivetrain would give me. \\n![](mecan_cad.png)\\n\\n### Point to Point\\nTo get the robot to move to a new target point, I need to calculate the amount the robot needs to move in the X direction, the amount the robot needs to move in the Y direction, and the amount the robot needs to move in turn. \\n\\nThe direction the robot moves will change depending on the desired end angle. Some trigonometry is done to figure out the relative directions the robot needs to go, as while the robot turns the motor powers will all change.\\n\\nThe final thing to do is scale everything down.  If X output and Y output both exceed the maximum power that can be sent to the motors, even if one is magnitudes larger than the other, the robot will end up going straight.  We solve this by scaling everything down to a larger number.\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbMDKJ0zA3o?si=T7nrteA03m6vQWDE\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n```cpp\\nvoid point_to_point() {\\n  // Compute PID\\n  xPID.compute(current.x);\\n  yPID.compute(current.y);\\n  aPID.compute(get_angle());\\n\\n  // Vector math\\n  double angle = to_rad(get_angle());\\n  double raw_x_power = (xPID.output * cos(angle)) - (yPID.output * sin(angle));\\n  double raw_y_power = (yPID.output * cos(angle)) + (xPID.output * sin(angle));\\n  double raw_a_power = aPID.output;\\n\\n  // Set output powers\\n  int x_output = raw_x_power;\\n  int y_output = raw_y_power;\\n  int a_output = clip_num(raw_a_power, 60, -60);\\n  int max_xy = 110;\\n\\n  // Vector scaling \\n  if (fabs(raw_x_power) > max_xy || fabs(raw_y_power) > max_xy) {\\n    if (fabs(raw_x_power) > fabs(raw_y_power)) {\\n      double scale = max_xy / fabs(raw_x_power);\\n      x_output = clip_num(raw_x_power, max_xy, -max_xy);\\n      y_output = raw_y_power * scale;\\n    } else {\\n      double scale = max_xy / fabs(raw_y_power);\\n      x_output = raw_x_power * scale;\\n      y_output = clip_num(raw_y_power, max_xy, -max_xy);\\n    }\\n  } else {\\n    x_output = raw_x_power;\\n    y_output = raw_y_power;\\n  }\\n\\n  // Set motors\\n  raw_set_drive(x_output, y_output, a_output);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nMecanum drives that use the VRC wheels are slower when strafing than in forward / backward.  Because of this, I knew I\'d want a mode where the robot would go straight for most of the motion and then turn at the end to face the desired angle. \\n\\nThis piece of code was added to the above function.  It modifies the target angle depending on how far away the robot is from the target position.  If it\'s more than 12\\" away, the robot will go faster and face the target position.  Once the robot is within 12\\" of the target it\'ll start to rotate to the desired angle. \\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIiadWcYlac?si=JW_q3pCaxF9RjtR2\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n```cpp\\n  // Add for direction\\n  int add = dir == REV ? 180 : 0;\\n\\n  // Set angle target\\n  double a_target;\\n  if (fast_move) {\\n    if (fabs(distance_to_point(target.x, target.y)) < 12) {\\n      only_look_at_point = false;\\n      a_target = target.theta;\\n    } else {\\n      only_look_at_point = true;\\n    }\\n  } else {\\n    a_target = target.theta;\\n  }\\n\\n  if (only_look_at_point) {\\n    a_target = absolute_angle_to_point(target.x, target.y) + add;\\n  }\\n\\n  // Compute angle PID and find the shortest path to the angle\\n  aPID.set_target(relative_angle_to_point(a_target));\\n  aPID.compute(0);\\n```\\n\\n### Paths with Strafe\\nThe paths the robot will follow will be points the user inputs.  In the example below, the robot will start at (0, 0), travel to (0, 24), then to (24, 24), then back to (0, 0).\\n```cpp\\nvoid autonomous() {\\n  pure_pursuit(\\n        {{{0, 24, 0}, FAST_MOVE_FWD},\\n         {{24, 24, 0}, FAST_MOVE_FWD},\\n         {{0, 0, 0}, FAST_MOVE_REV}});\\n  wait_drive();\\n}\\n```\\n\\nOnce I have a list of points, to decide which point to go to next I see how far away the robot is from the next point.  The target position gets shifted until we\'re looking at a point that is a distance away from the robot, and it keeps changing until we\'re at the final position in the list. \\n```cpp\\nvoid pure_pursuit() {\\n  raw_move_odom(movements[pp_index]);\\n\\n  if (fabs(distance_to_point(movements[pp_index].target.x, movements[pp_index].target.y)) < 5) {\\n    pp_index++;\\n    if (pp_index >= movements.size()) {\\n      pp_index = movements.size() - 1;\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  point_to_point();\\n}\\n```\\n\\nI cleaned up how the \\"turn type\\" is handled.  There are now 3 turn types:  \\n`FAST_MOVE` where the robot faces the target position and within 12\\" will move to the final angle\\n`LOOK_AT_TARGET` where the robot doesn\'t care about the end angle, and will always look at the target\\n`HOLD_ANGLE` where the robot will just hold its angle\\n\\nI had to add `LOOK_AT_TARGET` because the distance away from the current target was less than 12\\", and the robot would always hold an angle even if I didn\'t want it to.  This lets me use `FAST_MOVE` as intended, and have all of my injected points follow `LOOK_AT_TARGET`.  \\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aUpCYLBIhE0?si=LELL8e9J1XWCjrY3\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n```cpp\\n  // Add for direction\\n  int add = current_turn_type == FAST_MOVE_REV || LOOK_AT_TARGET_REV ? 180 : 0;\\n\\n  // Set angle target\\n  switch (current_turn_type) {\\n    // Looks at the target until final distance then goes to the final angle\\n    case FAST_MOVE_FWD:\\n    case FAST_MOVE_REV:\\n      if (fabs(distance_to_point(target, current)) < TURN_FAST_MOVE) {\\n        a_target = target.theta;\\n      } else {\\n        a_target = absolute_angle_to_point(target, current) + add;\\n      }\\n      break;\\n    // Looks at target the entire motion\\n    case LOOK_AT_TARGET_FWD:\\n    case LOOK_AT_TARGET_REV:\\n      if (fabs(distance_to_point(target, current)) > STOP_UPDATING_ANGLE) {\\n        a_target = absolute_angle_to_point(target, current) + add;\\n      }\\n      break;\\n    // Holds angle the entire motion\\n    case HOLD_ANGLE:\\n      a_target = target.theta;\\n    default:\\n      break;\\n  }\\n```\\n\\n### Final Mecanum\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVcdgffsMnA?si=P3Cc8XRpN6KGd6hI\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  \\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A_Q_yBHhWSY?si=9qDZo20ImXHNNA5K\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## Tank Drive\\nNow the goal is to get this all working properly on a tank drive setup.

Students liked the idea of this, so they helped create a list of constraints that my robot needed to have:\\n- no intake\\n- no shooter\\n- block others from shooting discs\\n- block others from shooting expansive\\n- anti wedges and wedges\\n- needs to spin rollers\\n- follows VEXU rules (8 motor drive)\\n- eat all the discs from the center line during autonomous\\n- molded traction wheel\\n\\n## Design\\nTo block shots, we had an idea that we were calling a windmill.  This beautiful image made by \\"CAD\\" was made to showcase how the structure will work on this robot.  With two intersecting diagonals, the structure for a roller and the windmill support each other.  This all requires a sturdy enough drive train.\\n![](windmill_og_cad.png)\\n\\nWhen I was competing in Change Up, I made a drive base that used a 1/4\\" piece of 6061 aluminum for the main structure and had a piece of 1/16\\" sheet at the front.  I didn\'t realize at the time how overkill this bracing was, but this gave me confidence in making an extremely sturdy drivetrain with nothing but a 1/16\\" aluminum sheet. \\n\\nThis is my first draft of figuring out where everything will go.  I generated gears for the drive to let my 3.25\\" wheels go 510rpm, which has the robot moving at ~86\\"/s.  The drive channels are 1\\" square tubes that I\'ll bandsaw down the middle  The top and bottom plates are 1/16\\" aluminum that I\'ll order from Send cut Send.\\n![](1stdrive.png)\\n\\nWith how tall the motors are it needed some brace to stop the entire thing from bending backwards.  I added a triangle brace to the side of them and added in the gears that the top 2 motors will be spinning.  I\'ll need to make a plate to support the other end of those shafts later.\\n![](first_triangle.png)\\n\\nI added diagonals for the windmill and the roller mechanism.  The roller will be a 3\\" flex wheel spinning at 50rpm.  The windmill is a thin piece of nylon tube I found on McMaster, this will be very light and easy to spin up fast to block people from shooting discs.\\n![](windmill_size.png)\\n![](roller_and_windmill_strutcure.png)\\n\\nI designed a hub for the flex wheels where a 1/4\\" ID bushing would sit.  This would spin on a round standoff.  To interface the gear with the mechanism I have interlocking geometry between the gear and the flex wheel hub so the force gets distributed nicer.\\n![](flexwheel_mount.png)\\n![](roller_gear.png)\\n\\nI\'m using a 100rpm motor geared down 2:1 so the roller spins at 50rpm.  The idler gear is spinning on a round standoff that is also being used to mount the motor.\\n![](roller_assembly.png)\\n\\nI designed a hub to hold 1/4\\" ID bushings for the tube, and I have the same interlocking geometry between the gear and the tube.  This is geared 1:1 and will use a 600rpm motor.\\n![](windmill_gearbox.png)\\n\\nA problem the windmill has is expansion.  A robot cannot be larger than 18\\" when entering the low zone, and this is larger than 18\\" unless it\'s parallel to the ground.  To solve this I\'m adding a ratchet so that when the motor spins backward the windmill will sit in a position where it\'s not larger than 18\\".\\n\\nThe pink pawl will be rubber banded to click into the ratchet.  When the windmill spins in one direction, the pawl will slop and this will be allowed to spin.  When the motor spins in the opposite direction, the pawl will engage the ratchet and this will sit in size.\\n![](ratchet.png)\\n\\nThis robot will be doing a lot of pushing and I need to make sure nothing on the drive breaks.  For the gears on the omni wheels, I copied the spoke pattern in VEX\'s 3.25\\" wheel so this gear interlocks with the wheel.  All of the force will get distributed across the print, and screws will be used just to keep it from falling out. \\n![](wheel_gear.png)\\n![](omni_wheel_and_gear.png)\\n\\nThe molded traction wheel gets little T\'s around it so the rubber will have a harder time falling off.  There are also pools of open space around some of the T\'s to hopefully stop the rubber from peeling off.  This is similar to how I\'ve made molded wheels before, so I feel confident this will have no problems.  \\n![](traction_core.png)\\n\\nThe wheel also gets pocketing so a gear can interlock with it.\\n![](traction_wheel_and_gear.png)\\n\\nI made a part to support the motor shafts.  It screws into the motor gap and gets a lower mounting point that has a standoff going to the outer drive channel.  It can\'t go to the inner drive channel because the gear is in the way.\\n![](motor_shaft_support.png)\\n\\nI also changed up the motor mount triangle support to be in the center to give some more space on the outside.\\n![](motor_cap_with_triangle.png)\\n\\nFor the plow to take all of the discs off of the center line, I needed a pneumatic tank.  I made space for one in the center and made cutouts for the tank in the drive bracing.\\n![](tank_mount.png)\\n\\nBecause pushing discs with a flat surface isn\'t possession, I made the front of the robot able to turn into an angle.  This is still a flat surface, and when I drive along the center line all of the discs will come to my side of the field.\\n![](plow_cad.png)\\n\\nI used a spare wedge from Change Up and had a simple mount for it.  For everything to be in size, the wedge needed to start up and there\'s a piston to release it with the Star Wars battle droid-looking mechanism. \\n\\nAnd with that, the CAD was done.\\n![](final_cad.png)\\n\\nUltimately we found out it was illegal to use the windmill, so sadly that will not make it into the assembly.\\n\\n## Assembly\\n### Assembling Based on CAD\\nThe aluminum came in from Send Cut Send and looks great.\\n![](alu.jpg)\\n\\nThe tank and motor mounts all fit in nicely.\\n![](with_tank.jpg)\\n\\nI used (too much) dykem blue to drill the holes in the angles and c-channel.  I used calipers (not my nice pair) to scribe lines into the metal, and center punched hole by hole and made new lines based on those holes.  This was my first time doing this and it all went really well, the accuracy on everything is more than enough for what this is. \\n![](dykem.jpg)\\n\\nEverything is coming together very smoothly and as I planned.\\n![](lulu.jpg)\\n![](finished_roller.jpg)\\n\\nThe plow uses zip ties to push discs, these were eventually cut to not touch the floor.  I used zip ties because this needed to be stiff enough to push a disc but flexible enough to allow the robot to go over a ~1\\" barrier, and zip ties accomplished that simply for me.\\n![](eyelash_in.jpg)\\n![](eyelash_out.jpg)\\n\\nI added pivoting pieces of plastic to the side of the robot to stop opponents from being able to push as well.  When they try to push me, they\'ll drive up me and add weight to my robot.  It will still be possible to push but less effective.  These are on hinges to ensure they always touch the ground and are lower than the opponents.  This type of anti-wedge was inspired by the Battle Bots robot Hyrdra.\\n![](anti_wedge.jpg)\\n\\nThe wedge is mounted to lift up opponents a bit when pushing them, which makes this robot functional!\\n![](banner.jpg)\\n\\nLater I made the traction wheel and got that mounted.\\n![](mounted_traction.jpg)\\n\\n### Lift\\nWith no windmill, I felt like this robot needed a way to block *something*.  What I decided on building was a 6 bar that is rubber banded up and locked to the chassis with a piston.  \\n\\nThe first thing to do is design a mount for the lift to sit on, I made this out of 1/16\\" 6061 and mounted it through the roller.\\n![](first_lift.jpg)\\n\\nBecause the geometry between these bars is strange, I prototyped the shape of the connecting linkage with cardboard.\\n![](middle_linkage.jpg)\\n\\nI made the top linkage out of some 1/16\\" polycarbonate angle I had, and this lift was pretty light and able to lift high enough to block the entire goal (which is illegal, but I can do it!).  This is still using a prototype final linkage though.\\n![](lift_raised.jpg)\\n\\nAnd with a real linkage made for the last vertical, this lift can rise to a height of 51\\".\\n![](lift_with_real_linkages.jpg)\\n\\nI made printed hooks that held onto arms and stopped them from coming out.  When the lift was raised, these arms would extend outwards.  This extra width would allow me to make an expansion blocker that is much wider than I otherwise could.\\nhttps://youtu.be/AdtnW2aCjzA?si=CMxP5raOcw8IP5xM\\n<iframe width=\\"315\\" height=\\"560\\"\\nsrc=\\"https://youtube.com/embed/AdtnW2aCjzA\\"\\ntitle=\\"YouTube video player\\"\\nframeborder=\\"0\\"\\nallow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\"\\nallowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<iframe width=\\"315\\" height=\\"560\\"\\nsrc=\\"https://youtube.com/embed/fhauUic9YH4\\"\\ntitle=\\"YouTube video player\\"\\nframeborder=\\"0\\"\\nallow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\"\\nallowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nTo actually block, I used an old bed sheet I had.

This meant I had to make double the amount of awards.  \\n\\nRECF sends some awards for free to give out for your first event.  We could have bought the rest of the trophies from RECF / VEX, but for a similar price, we made custom cooler awards that we felt teams would be happier getting.  I ended up making custom awards for the highest awards (excellence, tournament champion, robot skills) and made my own plaques for the standard VEX trophies.  \\n\\nThe award list to make is:\\n- Excellence x2\\n- Tournament Champion x4\\n- Skills Champion x2\\n- Design x2\\n- Judges x2\\n- Think x2\\n- Build x2\\n- Create x2\\n- Volunteer of the Year x1\\n\\n### Special Awards\\nI did research into how other teams made their awards.  These two stood out to me the most.  I liked having game elements behind the award, and I liked the aluminum plate for the front.  \\n<img\\n  src={require(\\"./aubie_award.png\\").default}\\n  alt=\\"Example banner\\"\\n  style={{ width: \\"37%\\", height: \\"auto\\" }}\\n/><img\\n  src={require(\\"./caution_tape_award.png\\").default}\\n  alt=\\"Example banner\\"\\n  style={{ width: \\"50%\\", height: \\"auto\\" }}\\n/>\\n\\nMy first attempt had the discs purple instead of yellow for supernova colors.  I felt this took away from the point of them being game elements from that year, so I changed the purple to yellow.  This part will be made in 2 parts, one that I change the filament halfway through to get the yellow, and one to go around that and act as a border.  \\n<img\\n  src={require(\\"./purple_disc.png\\").default}\\n  alt=\\"Example banner\\"\\n  style={{ width: \\"43%\\", height: \\"auto\\" }}\\n/><img\\n  src={require(\\"./yellow.png\\").default}\\n  alt=\\"Example banner\\"\\n  style={{ width: \\"43%\\", height: \\"auto\\" }}\\n/>\\n\\nWith the back of the part done, I started designing the front.  It needed to say `SUPERNOVA SPECTACULAR`, the name of the award, and the Supernova logo.  This meant for each version of the trophy the only thing I change is the bottom award name.  I made the image below to see if I liked the way this looked, but it is impossible to create like that because of floating material in letters like `O` and the inside of the Supernova logo.  \\n<img\\n  src={require(\\"./impossible_tc_render.png\\").default}\\n  alt=\\"Example banner\\"\\n  style={{ width: \\"43%\\", height: \\"auto\\" }}\\n/>\\n\\nThis was fixed with some connecting pieces between floating parts.

The rest of the screen could be split into a grid and just have a light gray outline to start.  As motor temperatures heat up, the color of the box will increase to eventually be the same color as the left/right buttons for the autonomous selector.  The closer they are in color, the warmer the motors are.  There\'s black text showing the name of the motor as well.\\n\\nI like this method of detecting temperature because under normal use the brain screen shows nothing.  Then as you use the robot more, you\'ll see something catch your eye and it reminds you to slow down / let the robot have a break.\\n\\nThis isn\'t documented or an officially released library yet, but the plan is to eventually set that up.

I also responded to community questions on the [forums](https://www.vexforum.com/t/harvard-westlake-robotics-amogo-x-dogo-reveal/92670) to make sure as much information as possible was clear about these robots. \\n\\n## Code\\n\\nThere were two versions of the code for each robot, one made in [VEXcode](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode) and one made in [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/).  \\n\\n### VEXcode\\nThe VEXcode versions of the code are much simpler and more digestible.  This is what most teams use to program their robots, so I wanted this code to be easily understandable by someone who had seen very little/no code before.  Everything is in a single file and all code relating to subsystems are bunched together so students can pick apart the code piece by piece.  \\n[AMOGO VEXcode - GitHub](https://github.com/Unionjackjz1/HW-AMOGO-VEXCODE/)  \\n[DOGO VEXcode - GitHub](https://github.com/Unionjackjz1/HW-DOGO-VEXCODE/)  \\n\\n### PROS\\nOn the other hand, the PROS versions of the code are more complex.  The code is split up into multiple files, where each subsystem has its own file.  The code for the drive base was based on the first version of [EZ-Template](https://www.roboticsisez.com/ez-template), which was my codebase that dealt with PID for getting the robot from point A to point B with very little setup.  \\n[AMOGO PROS - GitHub](https://github.com/Unionjackjz1/HW-AMOGO-PROS/)   \\n[DOGO PROS - GitHub](https://github.com/Unionjackjz1/HW-DOGO-PROS/)  \\n\\nThe PROS version of the code also came with a more complex autonomous routine that could complete the Autonomous Win Point by itself.  The Autonomous Win Point is a series of tasks that an alliance must complete during Autonomous to get an additional ranking point.  Doing this task by yourself can guarantee more opportunities for additional ranking points.  Because of the importance of solo AWP, we wanted to showcase that these simple robots could accomplish it.  \\n[AMOGO Solo AWP Autonomous Video](https://youtu.be/p1lgbKy1ZBE)  \\n[DOGO Solo AWP Autonomous Video](https://youtu.be/wpvR_m3cUFk)\\n\\n## CAD\\nThe CAD for each robot was also released so students could look at how different parts of the robot were assembled and see parts deep in the robot clearly.  There were some unique build techniques done specifically on the drive, where screws were used instead of axles.  \\n[AMOGO CAD - STEP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1teWAX4Hb_rwtznO7sPc-pv1EVGZGrDgA/view?usp=sharing)  \\n[DOGO CAD - STEP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y3QqJmkoS1UeejjGi8d0tq-_WFdEoL06/view?usp=sharing)  \\n\\n## Scrimmages\\nAt the end of the day, VEX robotics is a sport where matches are played competitively.  Everything else that was done for these robots was educational, but the end goal for all of this was to compete with a robot.  Scrimmages were published of both example robots competing head to head, while I was operating DOGO.\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yB3He_QHhds?si=IOW3jZL6EZ7wj8Cw\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7XZg8rz2fpE?si=HI677s-tDK2tyWO3\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCoMXwhrikM?si=jPz_Y9EtdrjJtDcx\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"},{"id":"vex-cadding-tutorials","metadata":{"permalink":"/projects/vex-cadding-tutorials","source":"@site/projects/2021-07-26-vex-cadding-tutorials/index.md","title":"VEX CADing Tutorials","description":"In order to reach the demand of students wanting to learn CAD, I developed click-by-click tutorials on how to CAD using Autodesk Inventor.","date":"2021-07-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 26, 2021","tags":[{"label":"vex","permalink":"/projects/tags/vex"},{"label":"mentoring","permalink":"/projects/tags/mentoring"},{"label":"tutorials","permalink":"/projects/tags/tutorials"},{"label":"cad","permalink":"/projects/tags/cad"},{"label":"open source","permalink":"/projects/tags/open-source"}],"readingTime":0.7933333333333333,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jess Zarchi","title":"Roboticist","url":"https://roboticsisez.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/Unionjackjz1.png","key":"jess"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"vex-cadding-tutorials","title":"VEX CADing Tutorials","authors":["jess"],"tags":["vex","mentoring","tutorials","cad","open source"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Harvard-Westlake- AMOGO x DOGO","permalink":"/projects/harvard-westlake-amogo-dogo"},"nextItem":{"title":"Ooga Booga & Frank","permalink":"/projects/vex-change-up"}},"content":"In order to reach the demand of students wanting to learn CAD, I developed click-by-click tutorials on how to CAD using Autodesk Inventor.\\n\\nhttps://wiki.purduesigbots.com/vex-cad/making-a-chassis\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nDuring COVID I taught CAD with Autodesk Inventor Professional to students who wanted to solidify designs without access to parts.

Together they fit in size constraints as 1 robot, and because they are connected they are considered 1 robot.  \\n![](oogabooga.jpg)\\n\\n### Ooga\\nThis was the main robot that had the brain.  Ooga had 10 motors.  6 drive, 2 intake, 2 conveyor.  The intake pneumatically closed for taking balls out of the goals.  \\n![](oogafront2.jpg)\\n\\n### Booga\\nThis was the puppet robot.  Booga had 7 motors.  4 drive, 2 intake, and 1 conveyor.  \\n\\nThe intake on Booga is different from Ooga or Frank, where Booga had larger wheels.  These wheels helped increase the intake range of the robot by flexing out the way.  The larger wheel meant if we hit a wall the intake would stop spinning, we solved this by putting the wheel on a 3D-printed slip clutch.  \\n\\nThe conveyor had only 1 motor but needed 2 functions: holding onto balls and scoring.  This was accomplished with ratchets.  Inside the conveyor wheels are pawls and the gears all have ratchets on them.  When the motor goes in one direction, only the bottom roller spins up.  When the motor goes in the opposite direction, all of the rollers spin up.  The bottom wheel goes the same way regardless of the input because of inverted ratchets on each side, similar to [this video](https://youtu.be/y44_xMFsPQQ?si=VBdRDJc-SNT6OzlC).\\n![](booga_1.jpg)\\n\\n## Frank\\nFrank was a smaller 15\\" robot.

Pneumatically actuated for removing balls from goals.  \\n\\nFor the conveyor, Frank used rubber band rollers instead of urethane wheels.  The concept of both is the same, but on Frank, we used a harder back material and squishy rollers.  \\n\\nThe center traction wheel on Frank was 3d printed, and we molded polyurethane around it. \\n\\n![](frankleft1.jpg)"},{"id":"goofy-ri3d","metadata":{"permalink":"/projects/goofy-ri3d","source":"@site/projects/2019-06-27-goofy - ri3d/index.md","title":"Goofy - Robot in 3 Days","description":"Goofy was a RI3D (robot in 3 days) that I participated in during the start of Tower Takeover.

I wrote autonomous routines using motion profiling, and adding automation while operating to make it easier on the driver.  I designed different stable and low-slop joints than Pancake, but most of all designed a robot that required very little maintenance after taking a beating.\\n![](worlds.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Notebook\\nIn VEX teams can create engineering notebooks and can win awards based on those notebooks and an interview process.  This is the notebook, our build/software log, that we made for this robot.  \\n\\nThis was never finished, so I\'ll add a summary of the remainder of the season below.\\n\\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1omhGB65uhTlaZRZvgxiF9jmN33fIssLbpcdErRU2LSE/edit?usp=sharing\\n\\nWe took the robot to SLO and were very happy with the performance, ranking 3rd and advancing to the finals.  Our biggest shortcoming was our autonomous not doing enough.  To be fair to our SLO performance, we were working on such a short schedule with how recently we got V5 and were able to put everything on the robot.  But there was something new we wanted to try. \\n\\nTeams have started making mechanisms to intake the balls off of caps during autonomous and using them to increase the efficiency of their paths.  We have an extra motor but would like to use it elsewhere, so we came up with a passive idea.  When our cap arm was raised it would release a rubber band allowing this standoff to fall into a cap, and when we drove backward the ball would tip into our robot.  This worked ok but was inconsistent and hindered intaking. So we decided to try something else.\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sLf9FCNjxXg?si=PpYmkTMX0hM2RHRr\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nWe decided to go a more typical route and make a motored arm, we called this a scraper.  This allowed us to tip caps, flip caps, and take balls off of caps and the platform.  \\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q3p2t34UsUw?si=WRuaxvga89343oH4\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nSoon we had to compete at Google, a signature event, where the winners would qualify for the World Championship.  We continued to practice and iterate on mechanisms that would fail to make them more robust.  We got picked in 8th place, and we made it to the semi-finals where we lost to the champions.  But, our Quarter Finals match is a good one.  We were against 1st place and our alliance was having trouble and was working on the robot.  The event couldn\'t wait any longer so we had to play as 1 team against 2.  And against all odds (with some luck) we ended up winning the match!\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3HrmSFPUpA?si=sLM_iQXf683_HbLx\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nWe ended up taking this robot to the State Championship and got picked for eliminations by 2nd place, and we advanced to Finals which qualified us for the World Championship.\\n\\nBetween the State Championship and World Championship we wanted to iterate everything.  Our drive struggled to get onto the platform, and our intake wasn\'t very fast, our scraper would get caught in the net sometimes. \\n\\nWe started fixing our list of problems by changing the shape of our drive.  We exposed the front wheel so as we climbed the platform it was easier to get on.  We also redid our intake structure to make sure it was much stronger.\\n![](start_of_rebuild.jpg)\\n\\nTo stop our scraper from getting entangled in the net we angled it back farther.  This required changing how the structure was done and needed chains instead of gears to fit everything.  \\n![](scraper.jpg)\\n\\nA big criticism of double catapults is the inability to shoot 1 ball at a time.  We had space for a ball to sit in our intake, so we added a sensor to detect a ball there and stop the intake.  This allowed us flexibility in scoring, and to not waste 2 balls when we only needed to score 1 flag.\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V6CQSywE5aw?si=X8tKsGa6JgXnVQVj\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  \\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCO3P55ZqEU?si=ol17lvWTlesXVRUx\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nAnd then it was off to the world championships!

We really liked how light and simple this robot was compared to how other robots looked.  \\n\\nThe problems with this robot were software and hardware.  At the time I didn\'t know how inverse kinematics works (or that it\'s not that complicated and I knew everything I needed to) so I was going to tune the movements for every cone.  The amount of force the zip tie intake took to grab a zone was very inconsistent, and getting the intake to spin correctly was hard.  \\n\\nHere\'s a good [album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/FW2f4SJD36dUvdjHA) of the robot failing to move how I want it to.\\n\\n![](1.banner.JPG)\\n\\n## Robot #2: Thinner is Better\\n*this robot existed for 5 days*\\n\\nThe idea for this robot was to make everything super thin.  I don\'t have much more to go off of with the 3 photos I have of it.  \\n\\n![](2.banner.JPG)\\n\\n## Robot #3: Maybe a Little Wider\\n*this robot existed for 6 days*\\n\\nThe base 4 bar was too thin and didn\'t leave enough room for the top 4 bar.  The construction of this robot is pretty similar starting out.\\n![](3.banner.JPG)\\n\\nAfter realizing there wasn\'t enough clearance or stability to be consistent, I tried to salvage it by picking up cones from the side instead of in front of the robot.  How it was built led to some huge levers and bending, so this was scrapped.\\n<img\\n  src={require(\\"./3.mistake1.JPG\\").default}\\n  alt=\\"Example banner\\"\\n  style={{ width: \\"42%\\", height: \\"auto\\" }}\\n/><img\\n  src={require(\\"./3.salvage.JPG\\").default}\\n  alt=\\"Example banner\\"\\n  style={{ width: \\"57%\\", height: \\"auto\\" }}\\n/>\\n\\n## Robot #4: The Widest Yet\\n*this robot existed for 15 days (new record!)*\\n\\nSomehow on this robot, the opposite mistake was made.  This robot was too wide.\\n\\nAnd this robot was scrapped once we realized it was [too wide](https://photos.app.goo.gl/DroWQUHgZUwW2bti8).\\n![](4.banner.JPG)\\n\\n## Robot #5: \\"Tube\\"\\n*this robot existed for 10 days*\\n\\nWith a tournament in 10 days and a robot that we felt wasn\'t salvageable, we needed to come up with something simple to compete with and fast.  After some discussion with team members and other competitors, we decided to attempt a new design we were calling \\"Tube Bot\\".  This robot would do small stacks, but the idea was if we could do them fast enough then we could spend the majority of the match playing defense. \\n<img\\n  src={require(\\"./5.sketch.JPG\\").default}\\n  alt=\\"Example banner\\"\\n  style={{ width: \\"60%\\", height: \\"auto\\" }}\\n/>\\n\\nThis robot will grab cones and drop them ~2ft onto the mobile goal.  If you\'re asking yourself \\"How would this be consistent?\\", I\'m asking myself the same question as I write this retroactively.  \\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r4a08b07Xvw?si=zy-66ASxoDyFq9n8\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\n## Robot #6: \\"Tube\\" v2\\n*this \\"robot\\" existed for 4 days*  \\n\\nAfter the *great* success the robot had at the tournament, we decided to make another version.  Luckily, this is as far as we got.\\n![](6.banner.JPG)\\n\\n## Robot #7: Finally a Normal Robot.  but smaller...\\n*this robot existed for 15 days*  \\n\\nThis robot was a step in the right direction.  This had all of the traits of a \\"meta-design\\" that the entire community was iterating on and pushing forward, except everything was smaller on ours.  The clearance between the top and bottom four bars was almost 0 and they would scrape constantly, the few intakes we tried didn\'t fit because of how far the mobile goal was sticking out of the robot, and we had strange pneumatic leaks that we couldn\'t find. \\n\\n ![](7.banner.JPG)"},{"id":"rerun","metadata":{"permalink":"/projects/rerun","source":"@site/projects/2017-03-12-rerun/index.md","title":"Rerun","description":"Rerun allows you to record robot movements and play them back during autonomous.","date":"2017-03-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 12, 2017","tags":[{"label":"vex","permalink":"/projects/tags/vex"},{"label":"software","permalink":"/projects/tags/software"},{"label":"open source","permalink":"/projects/tags/open-source"},{"label":"starstruck","permalink":"/projects/tags/starstruck"}],"readingTime":1.46,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jess Zarchi","title":"Roboticist","url":"https://roboticsisez.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/Unionjackjz1.png","key":"jess"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"rerun","title":"Rerun","authors":["jess"],"tags":["vex","software","open source","starstruck"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Middle of In the Zone","permalink":"/projects/middle-in-the-zone"},"nextItem":{"title":"Minecraft Plugin - Core","permalink":"/projects/minecraft-plugin-core"}},"content":"Rerun allows you to record robot movements and play them back during autonomous.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/Unionjackjz1/ROBO-DANNY/blob/master/RerunFunctions.c  \\n![](banner.gif)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nRerun works by tracking the velocities of all motors on the robot and running a velocity controller during autonomous to match those velocities.  The biggest problem with this code is it cannot react to changes in the robot, such as different banding or friction on a mechanism.  This version of the code is best used soon after the recording is made to ensure little to no changes to the robot.  \\n\\nWhile recording, the code would print to the terminal in a format that could be copied/pasted back into the code for running autonomously. \\n```cpp\\ntask\\nrecord( ) {\\n    startTask( calculateRPMs );\\n    int j = 20, s = 1;\\n    for( int i = 0; i < 400; i++ ) {\\n        if( j == 20 ) {\\n            writeDebugStream( \\"\\\\n\\" );\\n            writeDebugStream( \\"\\\\n   /* %i Second(s) */\\", s );\\n            s++;\\n            j = 0;\\n        }\\n        j++;\\n\\n        writeDebugStream( \\"\\\\n   auton( %i, %i, %i, %i, %i, %i, %i, %i);\\", iArmCurrentRPM, motor[ arm_l1 ], iChassisLeftRPM, motor[ chassis_l ], iChassisRightRPM, motor[ chassis_r ], iClawRPM, motor[ intake_l ] );\\n\\n        delay( 50 );\\n    }\\n    stopTask( calculateRPMs );\\n    writeDebugStream( \\"\\\\n\\\\n /* Stop the robot */\\\\n  auton( 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, %i, %i );\\", iClawRPM, motor[ intake_l ] );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPlaying the recorded run back uses a velocity controller.  The velocity controller is a P loop that `+=` to the motor.  This means if the motor is behind a bit, the motor will get a kick to get up to speed.  This is more accurate than setting the same PWM signal to the motors because it ensures at least the velocities are the same.  \\n\\nThe drivetrain used a modified version of this system.  I kept track of the PWM signal being sent to the drive as well, so the velocity controller used the recorded PWM signal as a starting point and modified it from there. \\n\\n```cpp\\nvoid\\nauton( int iArmDes, int iArmSpeed, int iChassisLeftDes, int iChassisLeftSpeed, int iChassisRightDes, int iChassisRightSpeed, int iClawDes, int iClawSpeed ) {\\n    int iArmError = 0, iChassisLeftError = 0, iChassisRightError = 0, iClawError = 0;\\n    for( int i = 0; i < 50; i++ ) {\\n        iArmError          -= (iArmDes - iArmCurrentRPM) * 0.015;\\n        iChassisLeftError  -= (iChassisLeftDes - iChassisLeftRPM) * 0.01;\\n        iChassisRightError -= (iChassisRightDes - iChassisRightRPM) * 0.01;\\n        iClawError         -= (iClawDes - iClawRPM) * 0.01;\\n\\n        arm( iArmError + iArmSpeed );\\n        motor[ intake_l ] =\\n        motor[ intake_r ] = (iClawError + iClawSpeed );\\n\\n        if( !bSide )\\n            tankWithoutTrueSpeed( iChassisLeftError + iChassisLeftSpeed, iChassisRightError + iChassisRightSpeed );\\n        else\\n            tankWithoutTrueSpeed( iChassisRightError + iChassisRightSpeed, iChassisLeftError + iChassisLeftSpeed );\\n\\n        delay( 1 );\\n    }\\n}\\n```"},{"id":"minecraft-plugin-core","metadata":{"permalink":"/projects/minecraft-plugin-core","source":"@site/projects/2016-01-25-minecraft-plugin/index.md","title":"Minecraft Plugin - Core","description":"Core is a simple Minecraft Bukkit plugin with the goal of being a lightweight replacement for all the features of Essentials that I used in my servers.","date":"2016-01-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 25, 2016","tags":[{"label":"software","permalink":"/projects/tags/software"},{"label":"open source","permalink":"/projects/tags/open-source"},{"label":"minecraft","permalink":"/projects/tags/minecraft"}],"readingTime":0.18,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jess Zarchi","title":"Roboticist","url":"https://roboticsisez.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/Unionjackjz1.png","key":"jess"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"minecraft-plugin-core","title":"Minecraft Plugin - Core","authors":["jess"],"tags":["software","open source","minecraft"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Rerun","permalink":"/projects/rerun"},"nextItem":{"title":"Destiny Nerf Blaster","permalink":"/projects/nerf-destiny"}},"content":"Core is a simple [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/) plugin with the goal of being a lightweight replacement for all the features of [Essentials](https://essentialsx.net/) that I used in my servers. \\n\\nImplemented features of core included teleporting between players, feeding to full hunger, healing to full health, announcements on server join and leave, and changing game mode. \\n\\nhttps://github.com/Unionjackjz1/Core"},{"id":"nerf-destiny","metadata":{"permalink":"/projects/nerf-destiny","source":"@site/projects/2015-02-24-nerf-destiny/index.md","title":"Destiny Nerf Blaster","description":"After watching a friend play Destiny I wanted to make something inspired by that game\'s aesthetic.","date":"2015-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 24, 2015","tags":[{"label":"hardware","permalink":"/projects/tags/hardware"},{"label":"nerf","permalink":"/projects/tags/nerf"}],"readingTime":0.4166666666666667,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jess Zarchi","title":"Roboticist","url":"https://roboticsisez.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/Unionjackjz1.png","key":"jess"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"nerf-destiny","title":"Destiny Nerf Blaster","authors":["jess"],"tags":["hardware","nerf"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Minecraft Plugin - Core","permalink":"/projects/minecraft-plugin-core"},"nextItem":{"title":"Mavshot Nerf Blaster","permalink":"/projects/nerf-mavshot"}},"content":"After watching a friend play Destiny I wanted to make something inspired by that game\'s aesthetic.  \\n\\nThis was a [Nerf Longshot](https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Longshot_CS-12) that I did minimal modifications to on the exterior functionally.
