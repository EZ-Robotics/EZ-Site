Goofy was a RI3D (robot in 3 days) that I participated in during the start of Tower Takeover.  We gave ourselves 72 hours to go from no design to a fully complete robot.   At the end of 72 hours we filmed a [reveal](https://youtu.be/QJI29QI5COM?si=_CvPY3BqpIup5Bqw), made the [code public](https://github.com/Unionjackjz1/Goofy-RI3D), and made a [VEXforum post](https://www.vexforum.com/t/448x-21s-6671x-and-1437z-ri3d-reveal/62602) to further share the design, and I edited a [documentary](https://youtu.be/BC4ZlIcBB7I?si=Kft1lqWfc1Vl6-A9) that explains our design process.  Combined the reveal and documentary have over 200k views.
