Geoffrey was one of my team's first competitive robots for the VRC season In the Zone, my junior year of high school.  This robot was designed to pick up cones and place them on mobile goals, then lift the weighted mobile goal to place it inside a higher-scoring zone.

This robot was the start of my build quality becoming more consistent and cleaner. 

The strategy and design for this robot didn't make much sense.  We were going for an external stacker that was fast enough to beat out internal stackers, and watching back matches it's very clear this isn't true.  Match review isn't something that happened this season at all, and it shows with this robot.
