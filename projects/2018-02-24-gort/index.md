Gort was my team's final competitive robot for the VRC season In the Zone. This robot is different from Geoffrey in that this robot would keep the mobile goal inside of the robot and stack cones internally.

I CNC'd polycarbonate drivetrain protection, operated the drive and mobile goal lift during matches, used weight-saving techniques, and made all of the software for the robot.
