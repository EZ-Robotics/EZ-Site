Gort was my team's final competitive robot for the VRC season In the Zone. This robot is different from Geoffrey in that this robot would keep the mobile goal inside of the robot and stack cones internally.

This robot had the potential to be amazing, and when it performed at its highest it was very good.  After the mistakes of how we spent the [middle of our season](https://www.roboticsisez.com/projects/middle-in-the-zone) and giving ourselves 1 month to build this robot, we did not have enough time to get this robot to the consistency it needed.
