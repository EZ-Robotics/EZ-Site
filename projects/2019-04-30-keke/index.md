Keke was my team's final competitive robot for the VRC season Turning point, my senior year of high school.  This robot used a catapult to shoot two balls at once to shoot two flags at once, could pick up and score caps and place them on poles, and could scrape balls off of caps or the platform.

My contributions as team captain went to every aspect of the robot.  I wrote autonomous routines using motion profiling, and adding automation while operating to make it easier on the driver.  I designed different stable and low-slop joints than Pancake, but most of all designed a robot that required very little maintenance after taking a beating.
