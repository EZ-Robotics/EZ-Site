Core is a simple [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) [Bukkit](https://dev.bukkit.org/) plugin with the goal of being a lightweight replacement for all the features of [Essentials](https://essentialsx.net/) that I used in my servers. 

Implemented features of core included teleporting between players, feeding to full hunger, healing to full health, announcements on server join and leave, and changing game mode.
