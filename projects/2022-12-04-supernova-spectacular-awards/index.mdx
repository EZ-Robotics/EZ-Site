For Supernova Spectacular 2022 I designed and made 19 custom awards to give out during the event.

The event was giving out 9 awards per competition, and we held a Middle School competition on Saturday and a High School competition on Sunday.  This meant I had to make double the amount of awards.  

RECF sends some awards for free to give out for your first event.  We could have bought the rest of the trophies from RECF / VEX, but for a similar price we made custom cooler awards that we felt teams would be happier getting.  

The award list to make is:
- Excellence x2
- Tournament Champion x4
- Skills Champion x2
- Design x2
- Judges x2
- Think x2
- Build x2
- Create x2
- Volunteer of the Year x1
